I am a MS student in [DCD](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yzhuang#582305) Laboratory at Zhejiang University , supervised by [Prof. Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang). My Chinese name is 谢君琳.

Before my MS journey, I graduated from Northwest A&F University,
with a bachelor's degree in Computer science and technology Engineering.
After graduation , I was successfully recommended to Zhejiang University as a master's student in Artificial Intelligence with excellent grades , **GPA-3.8/4.0 (Ranking within Top 1%)**.

I'm interested in machine learning and computer vision,and especially interested in multi-modal learning and video understanding. I hope that what I study can not only be theoretically feasible, but also be well implemented, combining industry and learning. I have a [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_37847767?type=blog) :).
