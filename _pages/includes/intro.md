I am a MS student in [DCD](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yzhuang#582305) Laboratory at Zhejiang University , supervised by [Prof. Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang). 
I'm interested in machine learning and computer vision,and especially interested in multi-modal learning and video understanding. I hope that what I study can not only be theoretically feasible, but also be well implemented, combining industry and learning.
